## Presentation

### Slide 1
- Group Name: Journey to the West (Original Y&L)

### Slide 2 - Why chose this project(10 words)
- Interesting: Bicycles are popular vehicles in our daily life, shared bicycles perfectly solves the problem of the last one mile in the city for people. It is also a healthy and eco-friendly means of transportation.
- Useful: Company will know when and where to set up more share bikes. And bike users know where they can find a share bike. It helps to offer services and maximize the use efficiency of every bike.
- Important: It helps company/investors to make decision based on statistics data chart.

### Slide 3 - Target Users
-  1. Citi bike-sharing company. If they want to expand their business in other cities or want to set more new stations, our website can help them to know more factors.
-  2. People who want to know information of bike-sharing. User can get some inforamtion from our website that help them use bike.
-  3. Competitor of citi bike-sharing. From our website, they can get some useful information and laws to help them make busniess decisions.

### Slide 4 - Motivation and Goal
- Sharing economy is popular in recent years. As one of typical sharing economy, Bike-sharing help lots of users especially citizen who lived in big cities make their trip easy and convenient. All of group members like to use sharing-bike.
- There are lots of factors may influence the site of stations, number of orders and other data. We would like to analyze different data to find potiential factors. And help bike-sharing company make decisions.
- There are lots of problems for bike-sharing. For example, some stations have lots of bikes for whole day, but some stations always lack of bikes. We hope to find borrow and return laws to help usr get their bikes anytime they need.


### Slide 5 - What others have done in this topic and what we do differently

- Relevant website
    - Other websites with the same topics focuses on statistics charts and spatial analysis. We could refer to some of charts such as returning bikes and borrowing bikes (per hour) statistics bar chart.
    - They are intended to show information to data analyst
    - They don't show a story about sharing bikes

- What we do
    - We used simple statistics charts to tell a story about sharing bikes, showing the temporal and spatial variation of stations and why they varied
    - Our charts are responsive and interactive. We optimized the visual queries and user interaction by multiple methos such as pop out effect, coupling effects and apporiate color scheme.

### Slide 7 - Station Map (Statistics Analysis)

- Two statistocs bar charts
    - Number of borrowing bikes per hour
    - Number of retruning bikes per hour
- Select any station of 6 years on map to see the statistics
- Repsonsive
- Interactive
- coupling


### Slide 8 - Main chart 2


### Slide 9 - Main chart 3


### Slide 10 - Main chart design/layout


### Slide 11 - Station infras analysis

### Slide 12 - Station infras analysis 2


### Slide 13 - Station weather analysis

- Based on our experiences, weather is a important factor that may influence orders. Because, we all don't want to ride a  bike at rainy data or snow day. So we got some data from new york open data site. Weather data includes maximum and minimum temperatures, perciption and other relevant data. Apart from weather, seasons is also a key factor that may influence orders.
- According to our chart, we found there more orders at spring, summer and autumn. And there are less orders on rainy day.
- In future, we will use more weather to find more laws between weather and users.

### Slide 14 - Station user analysis

- Zoom and burshes can help user read long period data more easily.

### Slide 15 - Who did what
