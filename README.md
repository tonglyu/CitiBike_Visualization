## Content

### Slide 1
- Group Name: Y&L
- Group Member: Ziwei Yuan, Tong Lyu
- Emails: Ziweiyua@usc.edu, tonglyu@usc.edu

### Slide 2 - Why chose this project
- Interesting: Bicycles are popular vehicles in our daily life, shared bicycles perfectly solves the problem of the last mile travel for people. It is also a healthy and eco-friendly means of transportation. 
- Useful: company will know when and where to put more share bikes. And bike users know where they can find a share bike. It helps to offer services and maximize the use efficiency of every bike.
- Important: It helps company/investors to make decision

### Slide 3 - Characters of the subject
- Spatial: The data can be visualized on a map. The distribution of bicycles affect the efficiency and convenience for people. The demand of shared bicycles varies among different regions in the city.
- Life: sharing bike is an important lifestyle.
- Business: business potential to invest sharing bike company

### Slide 4 - Who is the audience
- Investors
- Sharing bike companys
- Bike users

### Slide 5 - Data
- We found a dataset for citibike shared bike in New York, which contains the trip data for each bike. The attributes include trip ID, duration, start Time, end Time, start station's coordinate, end station's coordinate, trip route category, etc.

### Slide 6 - Story
- Distribution of shared bikes’ stations in New York on the map
- The most popular region/district for people renting bikes
- The change of numbers of renting in different seasons / weekdays / time series
- The duration bar charts (or other plots that reflects the duration for most bike users)
- Other factors (weather condition, etc) which will affect the number of rentings.

### Slide 7 - Interactive visuals
- people can pick any bike point on the map and check it’s summary chart like time series chart, bar charts
- We will develop a bar chart indicating the numbers of renting on each day during one year，people can click on the bar chart to see detailed infomatoin (statistics) on the map.

### Slide 8 - Design considerations
- Functionality: various form of visualization
- Multi-audience: offers different interface to audience for their needs

### Slide 9 - Cool
- Secret: User Oriented Design
- Offers two buttons to different audience (company/investor and bike users), helps them find the data visualization they want.
- Company/Investor: where to add more bikes
- Users: where can I find a bike (distribution of bike-share station)? When I have a chance to ride a sharing bike

### Slide 10 - Compare to what others have done
- Concise Content
- User Friendly
- User Oriented

### Slide 11 - Technologies
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript
- D3.js
- Bootstrap
- Angular (will explore)
- React
- MapBox/Google Maps

### Slide 12 - How to design and build
- Two user interface: bike users, company/investor
- In bike users interface: interactive station map, bar charts (start/end destination)
- Company interface: classify charts based on functions
-- Activity Analysis : By seasons/ months /week days/ hours
-- Station Analysis : Net activity by hours
- Use bootstrap for interactive framework
- Angular js and react: implement functions
- Unit test and integration test

### Slide 13 - Deliverables
- Demo video
- Final report
- Presentation 
- Source code

### Slide 14 - How to work
- Github recording the version of the code.
- Google docs recording history change
- Weekly meeting

### Slide 15 - Timeline
